# The New Bioeconomy: Advanced Biofuels

<!-- Biobased Energy Alternatives Biobased Fuel Sources -->
A framework for circular economies combining <b>non-food biomass</b> with long-term carbon capture

Advanced (second-generation) biofuels are made from non-food biomass and include ethanol, gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and resulting green hydrogen. The non-food biomass input for these advanced biofuels include lignocellulosic plant material (wood waste, forest residues, saw mill dust, corn stover and woody crops), municipal solid waste (MSW) and animal waste. Input does not include high-sugar alternatives such as corn and sugarcane.

Our proposed work investigates the long-term carbon capture potential of three new biofuel industries: 

1. Gas Fermentation (324110B1) - Syngas fermentation to ethanol to isobutene to higher olefins to fuels.  

2. Thermochemical (324110B2) - Syngas to liquid fuels via Fischer-Tropsch.  

3. Guerbet Biochemical (324110B3) - Syngas to molybdenum disulfide-catalyzed alcohols followed by fuel production via Guerbet reaction.  

Each of these bioproducts is a compariable substitute for Petroleum Refineries (324110).<!--which has a current Price of Commodity ($/GGE) of $1.60.-->  

## Addition of Biofuels Technology Sector

The following method was created in the summer of 2020 to add a biofuels commodity sector to the US Input-Output model. This methodology can be generalized to add any new commodity that is produced with multiple new technologies (industries) and a single new commodity output. This methodology is not generalizable for all new technologies, since other technologies may generate multiple commodities from combinations of industries. - [Details](docs/LCA%20New%20tech%20Methodology%20%28V02%20CGA%202020-08-05%29.pdf) / [GitHub](https://github.com/modelearth/useeior/tree/Bio-Modeling)
