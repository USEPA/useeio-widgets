# Industry Evaluator

### Purpose

The Industry Evaluator application allows users to compare the economic and environmental impact of potential industries as they weigh options for recruiting companies and new technologies to their region.  

### Intended Users

Community planners, economic developers, educators, students and the general public investigating economic transitions.

### Questions to Inform

Is the recruitment of a specific industry preferable to another? Based on what economic and environmental impacts?  

What existing suppliers are present and how might they feed into a prospective industry?

What educational demographics and regional college or technical programs might provide an available workforce in this region?

If we do recruit an industry, how can we work with them to reduce the environmental impacts of their supply chain input and production output, while increasing employment levels and value-added revenue?
